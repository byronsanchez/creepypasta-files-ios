 
 NOTE:

 Different parts of the project are licensed under different terms.
 This is necessary to provide extra flexibility for usage of non-source
 code files (images, media, etc.) outside of forks. This is also
 necessary because the default is "Copyright, All Rights Reserved."
 But you CAN use the code and images. This is me telling you this
 "officially." Here are the details.

 1] The "Creepypasta Files for iOS" source code is copyrighted by me
    and licensed under the MIT License. See the COPYING file for the
    full details.

    dependencies) are licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution

    Attribution not required, but it would be nice!
