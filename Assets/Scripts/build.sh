    DO NOT PROCEED IF YOU HAVE NOT SET UP THIS SCRIPT'S CONFIG VARIABLES!

    This script is meant to be executed only once, right after a git clone
    (of the master AND submodule repositories). Run this script from the
    root of the project directory.

    It will customize the repository so that the application can compile
    properly, using your own IDs for various components. If you do not set
    up these components (either by running this script or through manual
    configuration of the necessary files), the application will NOT
    run properly. It may not even compile.

    To setup the necessary config variables, open build.sh in a text editor
    and only modify the CONFIGURATION section. Do not modify \$PROJECT_DIR,
    unless you are moving the build.sh file.
