build.sh

  This script is meant to be executed only once, right after a git clone
  (of the master AND submodule repositories). Run this script from
  the root of the project directory.
  
  It will customize the repository so that the application can compile
  properly, using your own IDs for various components. If you do not set
  up these components (either by running this script or through manual
  configuration of the necessary files), the application will NOT
  run properly. It may not even compile.
  
  To setup the necessary config variables, open build.sh in a text editor
  and only modify the CONFIGURATION section. Do not modify $PROJECT_DIR,
  unless you are moving the build.sh file.
